# Arduino-Light-Automation-master
An IOT based project for home automation
It's an arduino based project in which with the help of api.ai I created a chatbot wich was linked with the heroku app in which our json file was running.So we linked our arduino with a wifi module so as to connect with the file and change the light from on to off and vice versa.The chatbot was further connected to messenger so as to get the input from user and generate the output.
